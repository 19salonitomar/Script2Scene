# Text-to-Image Generator

This project is a Text-to-Image Generator application built using Streamlit for a beautiful and interactive user interface. It leverages Stable Diffusion models and Hugging Faceâ€™s generative models to create images based on text descriptions. The application is designed to be easily run and modified using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Streamlit to provide an intuitive and visually appealing web interface.
- **Advanced Text-to-Image Generation**: Uses Stable Diffusion and other generative models from Hugging Face for high-quality image generation.
- **Customizable**: Easy to adapt and expand with different models or additional features.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Python extension
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-image-generator.git
    cd text-to-image-generator
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Download Model Weights**:
    - Ensure you have the necessary model weights and configurations. This may involve setting up Hugging Face credentials and downloading models.

## Running the Application

To start the Text-to-Image Generator application, run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. **Enter a Text Description**: Type a description of the image you want to generate in the input box.
2. **Generate Image**: Click the "Generate" button to create an image based on your description.
3. **View and Save**: The generated image will be displayed on the page. You can save it by right-clicking and selecting "Save image as...".

## Configuration

You can modify the configuration settings such as model paths and generation parameters by editing `config.py`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Download Issues**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and a valid Hugging Face API token if required.
- **Environment Issues**: Make sure all dependencies are correctly installed and the virtual environment is activated.
